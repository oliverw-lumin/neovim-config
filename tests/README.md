Run `python3 tests/run.py` from this config repository. Requires Neovim and the
plugins already installed by this config. The integration test starts Neovim
with the installed user config, creates a temporary Git remote and checkout,
and stubs GitHub responses. It never posts reviews or fetches a network remote.

Coverage: persistent repository-scoped list and summary caching, expiry, empty
results, fetched-ref reuse, missing refs, stale advertised SHAs, in-flight sharing, cancellation,
picker-to-open handoff, explicit refresh, error recovery, actual Diffview opening
with changed and empty PRs, file navigation after the overview, and overlapping
open requests. The 1.9-second assertion catches the former fixed two-second wait;
printed timings use local Git and mocked GitHub, not real-network benchmarks.

LSP coverage also checks package-root callbacks, linked-worktree paths, excluded
lint servers, duplicate attachment, deferred visible-buffer attachment, and `gd`
against the real Mason-installed Lua language server. Install that server before
running the suite. No fixture language server accesses GitHub.

The real Telescope picker is also exercised through preview and selection. A
late direct-number metadata response cannot replace a newer review selection.

The editor tests additionally cover asynchronous Make jobs and error output,
executable discovery in paths containing spaces, quickfix/location-list deletion,
formatter ownership in monorepos, large-file limits, lint debounce/save-only Go
checks, lazy plugin loading, independent debugger configuration, and LSP highlight
attachment/detachment. The full-config integration tests perform a real Lua
language-server definition lookup and a real CMake configure/build in a temporary
project (requires `make`, `cmake`, and a POSIX shell). Python/Go/LLDB debugger
configuration is checked, but full debug sessions are not launched by the suite.
